#Typography extension for Python-Markdown

Forked from [kmichel/markdown-typografix](https://github.com/kmichel/markdown-typografix),
which was automatically migrated from [Google
Code](https://code.google.com/p/markdown-typografix). I've fixed a
bug, cleaned up the directory, and added a `setup.py`.

To install:

	pip install git+https://github.com/anjiro/markdown-typografix
